I have a number of articles to post on topics I'm interested in, things I want to explore and breakdowns of the stuff I'm working on.
<!--more-->
The topics will cover the themes you see across this site: game development, Bitcoin, software & hardware projects. I'll also be adding articles which will provide a look into the way I work on things, how I solve problems, which will hopefully help others overcome challenges and share in the learnings.
For now if you want to know more about me then head on over to my [about page](/about) to see more of my journey to where we are today.
