I have a number of articles to post on topics I'm interested in, things I want to explore and breakdowns of the stuff I'm working on.

The topics will cover the themes you see across this site: game development, Bitcoin, software & hardware projects. I'll also be adding articles which will provide a look into the way I work on things, how I solve problems, which will hopefully help others overcome challenges and share in the learnings.

For now if you want to know more about me then head on over to my [about page](/about) to see more of my journey to where we are today.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
