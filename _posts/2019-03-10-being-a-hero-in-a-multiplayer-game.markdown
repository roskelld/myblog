Single player games often focus on creating an experience centred around the player as a hero of a story.
Using a narrative setup based around the player being a hero, or becoming a hero, allows developers to use both the gameplay and story as a means to elicit strong positive emotions from a player.

Non-story game
Scenario 1: A puzzle game in which the player beats a level and is shown a score screen.
This creates a good feeling because the player understands the challenge they overcome, they understood the points of failure they avoided. The score screen reflects this state.
Story Game
Scenario 2: A situation is described to the player where a village is under attack, and if they can stop the attack they'll save many lives.
The player defeats the attacking enemies during the course of the level and saves the village.
This creates a good feeling both because the player understands the gameplay challenge they overcome, but also the narrative reason for saving villagers offered a more human emotion to connect to, unlike the wholly abstract idea in the puzzle game.

An advantage of creating a single player game is that the developer can silo each player apart in order to develop a story which focuses on making them feel the hero without needing to acknowledge other players as they play no role outside of their own instance.
This is where games can offer a different experience from books or movies as they can actually generate scenarios about each audience member. Player's champion themselves through their avatar whereas in movies and books audiences must get behind the goals of a hero character and support them but have no control over if they achieve the goals or not.

This structuring of a hero narrative often uses a template based on and around [The Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey).

Examples:
Zelda Ocarina of Time
Star Wars
Moby Dick

The focus in this article is to ask **what does it mean to be the hero in a multiplayer game?** But first, let's talk about why we've seen this shift to multiplayer games.
### A New Player Has Entered The Game
 As technology improved we saw a great shift away from developers creating games that focused on the single player to experiences that put players together, either competitively or co-operatively.
### Online Services
The reason for this shift wasn't entirely due to player demand, the platform creators who had invested large sums to develop the online infrastructure and wanted to see a return, which helped incentivize publishers who wanted to maintain strong bonds with the console manufacturers. The developers and designers then found it much harder to pitch a single player experience into the market space, so developers then had to adapt.
Many developers pitched games that had a hybrid approach in which a single player game could still be sold by the effort of bolting on a mostly or completely disconnected multiplayer mode.
### Resale Value
Another reason for this shift was down to control. Single player games had the downside of being resellable. Once a player had finished the game they could sell it on which meant the publisher would ultimately sell fewer copies as they would have to compete with a market full of cheaper second-hand copies of the game of which they'd earn nothing from.
Adding multiplayer to a game enabled publishers to attach accounts meaning that even if a game copy was resold the new owner wouldn't have access to portions of the game, often the multiplayer but sometimes other parts such as DLC, because shipped with the game was a one-use code. So the new owner of the game would have to repurchase these portions to get full access, thus rewarding the publisher with revenue from the second-hand market.
### Piracy
Games with multiplayer often require some form of user login and/or server authentication. This allows publishers to combat piracy as they can detect pirate copies or users who haven't paid for a game much easier than with offline single player games.
### Monetization
One of the striking differences commonly found between single player and multiplayer games is the structure. As we've seen, single player games often have some sort of finality to their structure, the player journies through a story, beats the game and then outside of a few modes and variations they've basically experienced all of the content and can, therefore, move on to other things.
Multiplayer games often seek out a design that doesn't have such an endpoint focusing on some form of cyclical design in which the game doesn't end but gets harder or has sports like competitive experience which is hopefully infinitely repeatable.
With this design style, it opens up the door for a continued monetization stream in which players are happy to spend more money on something they play to keep on playing, especially when there are other real humans who can see the results of these purchase with things like costumes and characters.
## Many Heroes
To create a scenario in which there are multiple players developers need to consider how the game recognises each player are how it reflects on them, it also needs to consider how players perceive each other.
If a traditional hero narrative from a single player game is lifted into a multiplayer one it creates a conflict, as described the situation in a hero based game is to focus the praise on to the player's avatar in such a way that

## Problems
Putting multiple players into a game which wants to elicit the experience found in a single player game with the hero story adds many points of complication which need to be resolved or reasoned with in order to build out an experience which hopes to sell the same emotional response.

### Out of Sync Player Progression
In a purely single-player experience progression is only an issue between players externally, in that if one player is ahead of another in the game, then they might fear to talk about it due to story spoilers.
In a multiplayer game, there's a strong incentive for players to play together, but they might find that they don't have equal available play time so one might find themselves further into the story than the other.

#### What options might we have to resolve this?
##### Let then sync up their stories
* Syncing the behind player forward presents an issue in that they'll skip past story content either missing out or spoiling events before they'd ideally want to see them.
* Syncing the in front player back means that player will be repeating already finished content. Saving the village for the second time pushes to break the immersion.
* Sync only players who are at the same point in the story. This will keep players inline but in order to achieve this a steady flow of players will be needed. Easier during and around launch time, but perhaps much harder as the game ages. Also, it's less likely players will know each other so will mean playing more with strangers.
##### Structure a Non-linear story
* Create a non-linear setup where one mission doesn't follow another in a strict fashion allowing players to join together and pick and chose from an available pool which suites all parties. This may prevent or challenge a way to build a more scripted start-to-end narrative, as each player will play in a differing non-linear fashion.
* Create a hybrid structure of mini-narratives that can be played in a non-linear fashion, allowing players to sync up to either the same state within a narrative or start a new one fresh. This offers the developer to create arcs but isn't as restrictive overall as a completely linear narrative that covers the entire story.

### Choose Your Path
Game developers like to exploit interactions in many ways, one is giving players ways to interact with how a story unfolds by letting them chose or splitting the path in a story depending on how a player performs. Story paths fragment worlds as they realise new existences. If one player saves the village and another lets it burn, how do we resolve this when the two players come together

#### What options might we have to resolve this?
##### Joining a host player's world
* When players join together, select a host whos world state will be the setting for the session. This can be immersion breaking if other players see how the different choices play out, it won't be their home and therefore they'll feel less
##### Playing in a host player's world
Rather than play your own character, you instead play one in a selected hosts world. _Baldur's Gate_
##### Phasing

### Acknowledgement of Heroic Deed
You saved the village with other players in ad-hoc fashion does the game recognise this as a group effort

### Repetition of Content
